The image above is a contour plot in the complex plane that shows the error between our rational approximation to $\phi(z) = \frac{\log(z+1)}{\log(z-1)}$ and $\phi(z)$. The scale represents the magnitude of the error (for example, -13 means our approximation is accurate to 13 digits past the decimal point).

The poster below gives a brief overview of my work with Prof. Mitchell and my fellow reseacher Johan Azambou.
