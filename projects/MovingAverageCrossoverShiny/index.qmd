Shown above is a modified game board of Rail Baron. Each railroad is listed on the edge of the board, and the number next to each railroad shows it’s ranking based on our analysis in subsection 3.4, with 1 being the best railroad and 28 being the worst. The highlighted railroads on the board show the optimal network of railroads, chosen using our findings and experience playing the game. The legend in the bottom left corner displays a color-coded guide for each railroad highlighted. We wanted to display a network of railroads because one railroad on its own isn’t good enough; To win the game, one must concoct a network of railroads such that they can get to as many cities as possible.

The paper below was a project for Computational Linear Algebra at Macalester College.
