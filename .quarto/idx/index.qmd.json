As a captain, I have a variety of roles, from managing team finances and fundraising, to long-term planning. Being ingrained in the team so deeply has been very rewarding. And playing frisbee is one of those things that never gets old. \n\nI really love backpacking. My twin brother (also at Macalester) and I spend a week in the wilderness each summer, exploring new parks and places. Lately, we have ticked off Glacier National Park and Mt. Assiniboine Provincial Park in British Columbia off our bucket list. Staying active in ways that allow me to explore the outdoors is something that I look forward to every year, and backpacking is an activity that I can do for the rest of my life.\n\nI also enjoy games. As far as board games go, Terraforming Mars is my go-to. It's the most complex board game that I've found, which might be why I like it so much - there are more ways to gain an edge on my opponents. My goal is to enter a Terraforming Mars tournament, if such things exist. My other favorite game has to be Sudoku. It seems like such a simple game - place each digit 1-9 in each row, column, and sub-grid - and yet, I have found it to be very stimulating. I especially enjoy playing the many variants out there, including Chess, Arrow, and Thermal sudoku. \n\n### Get in Touch\n\n**Email**: <a href='mailto:osuelflo@macalester.edu'>osuelflo@macalester.edu</a>\n\n**Address**: 1600 Grand Avenue, Saint Paul, MN 55105\n\n**Phone**: 651-675-6384\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n:::{#intro-heading}\n\n# Owen Suelflow\n\nhe/him/his <br>\nStudent at <a href=\"https://www.macalester.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Macalester College</a>\n\n### Education\n\nPursuing BA in Math and Computer Science <br>\nAug 2022 - Present | Macalester College\n\nMinnesota PSEO Program <br>\nAug 2021 - May 2022 | University of Minnesota\n\n### Experience\n\nResearch Assistant under Prof. <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/macalester.edu/willmitchell/home?pli=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">William Mitchell</a> <br>\nMay 2023 - Present | Macalester College\n\nPreceptor (Teacher Assistant) in <a href=\"https://www.macalester.edu/mscs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MSCS Department</a> <br>\nfor MATH 135 & 137, COMP 127 & 365\nJan 2023 - Present | Macalester College\n:::\n\n### Biography\n\nMy interests lie anywhere I can combine my skills in the broad disciplines of math, computer science, and statistics to solve real-world issues.
