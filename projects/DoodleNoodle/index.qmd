Shown below is a recording of someone playing the game. The game has all of the features of the classic Doodle Jump game: Moving the character around using the arrow keys, shooting with the up arrow key, and jumping on top of the monsters. Platforms with a beige circle on them indicate trampolines, which allows the character to jump higher.
